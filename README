As part of the ITK v4 project efforts, we have developed ITK filters for
physics-based non-rigid registration (PBNRR), which satisfies the following
requirements: account for tissue properties in the registration, improve
accuracy compared to rigid registration, and reduce execution time using GPU
and multi-core accelerators. The implementation has three main components: (1)
Feature Point Selection, (2) Block Matching (mapped to both multi-core and GPU
processors), and (3) a Robust Finite Element Solver. The use of multi-core and
GPU accelerators in ITK v4 provides substantial performance improvements. For
example, in average for the non-rigid registration of brain MRIs, the
performance of the Block Matching filter is about 12 times faster when 12
hyperthreaded multi-cores are used and about 540 times faster when the Quadro
6000 with 448 threads is used in Dell Workstation.
